<p>Hi James. Here's that demo of our embed.</p>
<p>Try using the filters with the button in the top right corner.</p>
<p>Also, you can see a much longer list in action, with another trial feature (embedded videos) <a href="https://marcharrison.net/embed">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Please note - this embed feature needs work. It was built by ME, and I am just a business guy who likes to pretend he can write code. Imagine what we could do with a designer and a developer!</em></p>
