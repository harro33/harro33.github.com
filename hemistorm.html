<p>Hi Chris!
<p>This page of my website is visible to anyone, however there is <strong>no
link to it on this website and it is hidden from Google and other
indexes</strong>. It's purely for me to demo Listium to you.</p>
<p>This embed is just a proof of concept. It was built almost solely by me, but I am not a developer. Once I get
   a bit of help from our developer, and some feedback from actual users, I hope to improve it substantially.</p>
<p>Note: the list that is embedded here is on our "staging" server. From time 
  to time we may be testing other builds of Listium, so things may not always 
  work as expected if you decide to load this page at some random time. But it will be working when I am talking to you!</p>

  <p>Some thoughts on why Listium could be an interesting option for video playlists, even though that is not our primary use case:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Take advantage of our core features like sorting, filtering, grouping, and custom fields. (See button in top right corner of the embed).</li>
  <li>Let users watch videos on your own website WITH text description, including affiliate links.</li>
  <li>In other words, <strong>you don't have to send your visitors to YouTube for them to see your affiliate links.</strong></li>
  <li>Keeping them on your site means they won't see suggested content from other creators shown to them by the YouTube algorithm, so you don't run the risk of them 
    getting distracted or, worse, clicking on an affliliate link of another creator before they purchase a product you recommended.</li>
  <li>You still get the video views, and there is still a button on each video for people to subscribe to your channel.</li>
</ul>
  <p>I'll update you when this goes live on our site.</p>

<p>Just for interest, this is what an official YouTube playlist looks like when embedded on aonther site.</p>
