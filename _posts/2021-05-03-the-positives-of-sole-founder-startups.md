## Introduction

When it comes to the topic of sole-founder versus multiple-founder startups, the debate is almost always about whether being a sole founder is a bad thing or a *really* bad thing?".

I am not sure if I have ever seen a post about the many positives of sole-founder startups.

However, there are some very clear positives of having just one founder. As a sole founder myself, I thought it was worth sharing my thoughts in case it helped anyone else who is in a similar position.

I've divided the factors up into two key areas - founder relationships and founder equity. I also address the positives of multiple founders in order to ensure this is a balanced article, and then I wrap-up with my thoughts on which is better (spoiler: it depends).

## The Positives of Sole Founders

### Founder Relationships

##### No risk of founder relationship breakdown

A common reason for early startup failures is the deterioration of the relationship between founders. Even founders who have known each other for a long time can find the stresses of building a startup become too much for them. It's no different to a marriage, where couples who have been together for years can still find that things change and they are no longer right for each other.

When a founder and a senior team member have a falling out, while it's not ideal, it's clear who stays and who goes. When two founders have a complete falling out, it's not always obvious what happens next.

A sole-founder business removes any risk of a failed founder relationship impacting the company because there is no founder relationship to fail.

##### One vision, one strategy and one plan

Even if a disagreement between founders doesn't lead to a complete failure of their relationship, it can mean weeks or months of valuable time are lost due to an inability for multiple founders to agree on key decisions. I liken it to coming to a T-intersection in a road where, even if you don't know the best way to turn, it is definitely better to turn left or right than to drive straight through the 
intersection.

Yes, the additional responsibility of being the one key decision maker can weigh heavily on some people. And yes, if the founder doesn't have a vision, strategy or plan then there are major problems. But a sole founder avoids the significant risk of the company being dragged in mutiple directions.

### Founder Equity

##### More equity for early team members and advisors

<strong>(I don't think this point gets enough attention!)</strong>

For a startup to become successful it is just as important to find great early team members as it is to have great founders. Often it will be more important because one or more of the founders might not be strong on execution, or might lack certain skills required to succeed or scale. One or more founders might even just be there because they were friends with another founder, not because they are outsanding performers.

A sole founder, from a starting point of 100% equity, can allocate a lot of very attractive equity stakes to team members and advisers before they drop below 50%, or the same shareholding they might have started with if they had just one cofounder. As you add more cofounders the equation only gets worse.

You would hope that having cofounders means less need for senior hires and advisers, but you had better make very sure they are the right cofounder(s) given how much equity will no longer be available for early hires and advisors.

##### Lower valuation (and why this is a GOOD thing!)

Another benefit of having fewer founders is that every capital raise can be done at a lower valuation while still maintaining a reasonable value on the founder's equity. For example, assuming equal founder stakes:

- A startup with four founders requires a pre-money valuation of $4M for each founder to have a stake worth $1M.
- A startup with a sole founder on needs a pre-money valuation of $1M in order for the founder to start with a stake worth $1M.

Some (usually less experienced) founders think a lower valuation is a bad thing. However, raising money for a startup is often much easier than delivering the results taht justy that valuation, let alone the results required for the value of the company to increase beyond that point. In other words, all other things being equal it is easier to achieve the results required to justify a low valuation than a high valuation. Unless a founder really needs cofounders for a particular reason, it might be preferable for many founders to start with a larger share and a lower valuation than it is to take on cofounders and reach for the higher valuation.

The argument against this is that early-stage startup valuations are more about supply & demand than risk & return, and many investors care less about valuation than other factors. So, while it might be better for many startups to start with fewer founders and a correspondingly lower valuation, if the investors care more about the number of founders then the valuation then the founders are stuck in a difficult position.

##### No risk of "dead equity"

Going back to the topic of founder relationships, a failure in a founder relationship doesn't necessarily mean the end of the startup. However, even if there is good documentation in place and some of the parting founder's equity can be repurchased, often they retain some shares in the company. The equity owned by a founder who leaves is often termed "dead equity" because that shareholder is unlikely to contribute any further time or money to help the company. New investors don't like this as it places all the load on the remaining founders and investors to make the company successful.

In no way am I saying that a departing founder should not retain some equity. If that person put in time, and was unpaid/underpaid for that time, they deserve to retain something approximating a fair amount of equity for their contribution. However, this does not overcome the fact that their equity will still be regarded as "dead equity" and this can create difficulties moving forward. A few percent may not cause too many issues but, if the startup has been around for a while and most/all of the founder stock has vested, founder stakes of 20%, 30%, or more, can create enormous issues for the company when it comes time to raise more capital.

## The Positives of Multiple Founders

This article is meant to help paint a more balanced picture of the sole-founder versus multiple-founder debate. I couldn't do that without listing the advantages of multiple founders, which are:

##### Spread the workload

It is easier, for example, for three people to do one year of unpaid work than one person to do three years unpaid. And it's a faster way to get the same amount of work done.

However, if you can raise money to hire the people you need then this is not an issue.

As the team grows, a higher share of the work is done by employees than founders so this issue reduces over time.

##### More skills and ideas

Just as more people give you more pairs of hands, it also gives you more potential variety in skills and ideas. Diversity of ideas and skills is important in all companies, including early stage startups.

Again, if you can raise the money to hire the good people then this is not an issue.

Also again, as the team grows the reliance on the founders reduces and the benefits of having multiple founders for their skills and ideas reduces.

##### Less risk of being left with no founder

The most obvious risk of having only one founder is that it only takes that one person to leave and the startup has no remaining founders. If the startup is still in the early stages, this has a very high risk of leading to the death of the startup.

However, not all startups with multiple founders have multiple founders capable of running the company. So, for many startups, investors may be worse off if the strongest founder leaves and one of the other founders demands to be made CEO simply because they are a founder. Just because a founder stays around after another one left, it doesn't mean the startup will survive the impact of that other founder leaving.

Also, in the case of a multiple founder business, it is arguably more likely that any one founder will leave because they believe the business will continue without them. In the case of a sole founder, they know that leaving could easily kill the startup so they should be more likely to stay when things get tough.

The fact that multiple founders will each have less equity than a sole founder could make it even more likely that they would leave because they have less to lose in terms of unvested equity.

##### Share the mental load

This is a big one for many founders. There is no doubt that being a startup founder is difficult in a lot of ways, particularly because of the mental strain. Having a cofounder might allow you to feel more relaxed about taking some time away from your startup, knowing that your founder has your back.

However, having a cofounder doesn't instantly remove all of the stresses of being a founder. It might even introduce some new stresses.

Being a sole founder doesn't mean you have to think about your startup every waking hour. There are many ways to handle mental stress that don't involve giving away a big share in your startup, including meditation, mindfulness, leaning on friends and advisers, and forming relationships with other founders who are going through the same thing. It's important to realise that your startup doesn't fail the moment you take a day or two away from it, and you often come back to it with a much clearer outlook if you do this regularly.

As mentioned earlier, hiring the right people in senior roles fills most of the gaps that might exist because of the lack of cofounders. Mental stress is no different, and the title of founder is not required for someone to care about your startup and take on some of the mental load. It's very possible to find senior employees who do a better job of relieving mental stress for a founder than many cofounders do. In fact, it could be argued that an employee has less of their own mental stresses to begin with so they have more capacity to take some of the load off you, relative to a cofounder who already has their own founder stress to deal with (and who may even need more support from you than you can get from them!)

To be clear, if you have the <em>right</em> cofounder(s) taking on their share of the mental load it can be a wonderful thing, but just having <em>a</em> cofounder is not a magic bullet for the very big issue of founder mental strain.

##### Perception

<strong>Here we are - the big one!</strong>

It's going to take a lot more than this article to change the perception that multiple founders is better than sole founders.

I mentioned that hiring good people is usually the way to offset the lack of cofounders. However, hiring people requires money and, unless the business is able to quickly generate significant revenue, it is almost certainly investors that are required to provide that money.

We have a bit of a catch-22, as investors are the key to building a great team and reducing the need for multiple founders, but some investors will only invest when there are multiple founders.

Hopefully we can start to change this perception because I am sure there are some great founders with great skills and great ideas that have the potential to build great startups, but they just don't happen to have a great cofounder in their life who is ready to join them at exactly the right time.

We all know the world is missing out if we don't give a lot more minority founders a reasonable opportunity to start a company, and this is being addressed. We need a lot more female founders, and many people are working on addressing that imbalance, too. There are many great founders outside California and investors are now actively looking at those opportunities.

Maybe it's time we realise that the bias away from sole-founders is either forcing some founders into cofounder relationshiops that could be detrimental for the startup, or is simply stopping some great startups from ever being built.

(Just to avoid any misunderstanding, I am not trying to equate a bias against sole-founders with discrimination based on factors such as sex or ethnicity. However, biases in decision making lead to sub-optimal outcomes all the time even if those biases are not as obvious or harmful as outright discrimination. This is not an article about doing something in the name of fairness, but about understanding facts and improving decision making).

## Sole Founder or Multiple Founders - Which is Better?

The only correct answer is "it depends".

##### It depends on the founder(s)

A strong founder with a clear vision and a lot of the necessary skills is going to have a better time as a sole founder than someone who lacks experience, confidence and skills. To think that all founders have an equal need for a cofounder simply doesn't make sense.

##### It depends on the product

Some startups are complex, others are simple. Some will take years to build, others can find rapid success. Some require a broad range of skills while others might only need a very specific set of skills. In other words, no two startups are the same meaning not all startups have the same requirements from the founders.

##### It depends on the stage of the startup

In the early stages it helps to have multiple founders for the simple reason that there are more people working on the startup who don't expect to be paid a salary, and more can be achieved before investors and/or revenue are required. The further advanced the startup, the more will be done by paid employees regardless of how many founders the startup has.

##### It depends on the ability to raise capital

Given that hiring employees is the obvious way to reduce the need for cofounders, the ability of founder to raise capital (in the absence of significant revenue) will directly impact how quickly they can start building the team.

## Summary

There is clearly no correct answer, and founders and investors should decide what is best for every startup on a case-by-case basis.

I hope this article helps some founders be more confident about going it along rather than partnering with someone who they don't really know or giving up because too many people tell them they can't succeed without a cofounder.

More importantly, I hope that more investors realise that the question is more complex than they might have thought, and will be more open to sole-founder startups based on the particular startup in question.

Investors want to invest in founders who, among other things, can analyse information, be open to new ideas, admit when they were wrong, and make the best decisions about how to move forward.

Founders have every right to want investors who can do the same, and that includes being open to the idea that the need for multiple founders is different for every startup.
