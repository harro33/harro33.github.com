<p>Hi, my nameâ€™s Marc and I'm the founder of <a href="https://listium.com">Listium</a>.</p>
<p>My early career was in banking and funds management before my interest moved to the startup world.</p>
<p>I have been an advisor or director to multiple startups where I have helped with funding, M&A, culture and HR, recruitment, strategy, analytics, and whatever else was needed.</p>
<p>I'm a generalist and my strengths include finance, product management, strategy, general management, and even a bit of design.</p>
<p>I am always trying to learn new things and improve myself, and I do this through a lot of <a href="/reading">reading</a>, as well as experimenting and learning from my (numerous) mistakes.</p>

<div id="Beliefs" class="about-section">
  <h2 class="about-category">Beliefs</h2>
  <ul class="about-list">
    <li>I <em>used</em> to vote Liberal (Australian conservative party) but <strong>now lean left</strong> due to right wing policies that are increasingly divisive and self-serving.</li>
    <li>I'm an <strong>Athiest</strong> and, while I try not to push my ideas on others, I am really not a big fan of organised religion.</li>
    <li>In addition to not being religious, I do not favour anything where faith/beliefs are allowed to take precedence over science (eg. climage change sceptics, the anti-vaxxer movement, the gun lobby, Trump supporters, etc.)</li>
    <li>I believe that capitalism has gone unchecked for too long and <strong>income inequality</strong> must be addressed as a matter of priority.</li>
    <li>I'm passionate about reversing the trend of increasing <strong>mental illness</strong>, and income inequality is arguably the largest contributor to this trend, most <strong>media and social media companies</strong> have a lot to answer for.</li>
    <li>I believe in the need for <strong>Universal Basic Income</strong> to share the benefits of innovation and reduce the impact of income inequality from the rapid shift of profits from labour to capital.</li>
    <li>I read a lot about <strong>behavioural biases</strong> in order to improve my decision making.</li>
    <li>I am borderline obsessive about <strong>truth and honesty</strong> in my personal and professional life, occasionally (and unintentially) at the short-term expense of people's feelings. I believe that in the long-term, the truth is the best approach.</li>
    <li>I believe that <strong>psychedelics</strong> like LSD and psilocybin have huge potential to help a lot of people who suffer various mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety and PTSD, and it's a terrible that we lost decades of potential research due to political rather than scientific reasons.</li>
