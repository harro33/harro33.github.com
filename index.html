<p>Hi, I'm Marc. I am the founder of <a href="https://listium.com">Listium</a>.</p>
<p>My early career was spent in corporate roles in banking and funds management, before my interest moved to the startup world.</p>
<p>I have been an advisor or director to multiple startups where I have helped with funding, M&A, culture, recruitment, strategy, analytics, executive coaching, product and design, amongst other things.</p>
<p>In the last two years increasing amounts of my time has been directed towards AI, including the technology, its uses, its future, and the ethics of its adoption. I am using AI heavily for Listium, personal projects and, more recently, helping other business owners on a part-time basis.</p>
<p>I love to learn new things and improve myself, and I do this through a lot of <a href="/reading">reading</a>. I am proud that my non-fiction bookclub is in its 17th year and we are approaching book number 100.</p>
