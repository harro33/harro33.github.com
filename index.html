<p>Hi, my nameâ€™s Marc and I'm the founder of <a href="https://listium.com">Listium</a>.</p>
<p>My early career was in banking and funds management before my interest moved to the startup world.</p>
<p>I have been an advisor or director to multiple startups where I have helped with funding, M&A, culture, recruitment, strategy, analytics, executive coaching, product and design, amongst other things.</p>
<p>I love to learn new things and improve myself, and I do this through a lot of <a href="/reading">reading</a>. I'm also known for trying lots of hobbies based on watching a few too many YouTube videos.</p>

<div id="Beliefs" class="about-section">
  <h2 class="about-category">Beliefs</h2>
  <ul class="about-list">
    <li>I'm a <strong>left/progressive voter</strong> due to right wing policies that are increasingly divisive and self-serving.</li>
    <li>I would love to see a <strong>Univeral Basic Income</strong> become a key tool in the fairer distribution of wealth.</li>
    <li>I'm an <strong>athiest</strong> and I believe that religion is partly responsible for the dangerous rise of beliefs being allowed to trump science (eg. climate, anti-vaxxers, etc) in the eyes of many.</li>
    <li>I read a lot about <strong>behavioural biases</strong> in order to understand myself and improve my decision making.</li>
    <li>I am borderline obsessive about <strong>truth and honesty</strong> in my personal and professional life.</li>
    <li>I believe that <strong>psychedelics</strong> have huge potential to help treat depression, anxiety and PTSD, and we need to put science ahead of politics and increase research into this exciting field.</li>
  </ul>
